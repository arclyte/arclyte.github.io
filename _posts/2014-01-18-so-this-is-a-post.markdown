I've been reading about Github Pages and Jekyll, so I decided what better way to learn about it than to actually do it.  I've been using Zurb Foundation on a few small projects over the past year or two, but need to learn Twitter Bootstrap a bit better, so I figured it'd be a good idea to merge the two, running a Jekyll blog on Github Pages on top of Bootstrap.

I'll post some more on the whole process once I have everything set up where it should be, and hopefully some more interesting stuff as well. For now, this will have to do.
